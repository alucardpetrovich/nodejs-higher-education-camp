# üè† Homework 8

- Cover users, posts and login endpoints with API tests.
- Cover users, posts and login services methods with unit tests (they should cover all logic branching)
- Cover users, posts and login repository (DAO) methods with integration tests
- Add CI/CD pipeline for running tests and deploying server to Heroku via Github actions. Heroku addons (like postgres) could be installed manually. For testing purposes let's trigger tests and deploy pipeline only when new code is pushed to `main` branch or branch of your homework. Task would be considered done only if Github Actions pipeline successfully deploying app to Heroku and mentor could see correctly working example of backend by provided public URL.
